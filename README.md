# Hand-Gesture-Classification
Hand gesture classification using Leap Motion Sensor

The idea of this project was to record images with Leap Motion Sensor and use them to train a CNN to classify those hand gestures. 
I used pretrained layers from VGG16, and added a Dense layer for my specific classification. 

You can see the database in this repositorium as well.

Also, you can find the code to run this simulation live and see how it works with your leap motion sensor.

Accuracy of my model on test data is 98.25%.
